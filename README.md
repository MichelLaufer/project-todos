# Project Todos

In this week's project at the Technigo boot camp, we have built a todo app practicing how to structure redux store, how to write reducers and actions and how to interact with redux store using selectors and by dispatching actions. In the todo app, the user is able to add and remove tasks, see a list of tasks and check whether a task is done or not. 

Tech:
<br>React, Redux, JavaScript (ES6), CSS, HTML</br>

I created several components and created buttons for adding and removing tasks and a "clear all"-button. I also created a button which display uncompleted tasks when the user clicks on it.
